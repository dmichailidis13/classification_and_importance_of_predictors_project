# classification_and_importance_of_predictors_project
In this project we classify we wish to determine which predictor of our dataset is the most important into causing dog food to spoil. We first create a typical Logistic Regression model using Spark and we suspect which predictor affects more. Then we utilise an attribute of tree methods and we verify out suspicion.
